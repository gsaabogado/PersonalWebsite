The ABM-REN model aims to understand households’ decisions to adopt green technologies.\nI also contribute to the 37th Energy Modelling Forum on high electrification scenarios in North America.\n\n\n Accepted and Published Manuscripts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Working Papers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Underway Research"
