### {{< fa play >}} Introduction

I employ techno-economic bottom-up energy models to examine transition pathways of the North-American energy system.

My research answers questions like:

-   What are the effects of variations in natural gas prices on the future of the North American energy system?
-   What is the role of storage technologies in the uptake of renewable energy?
-   What is the future of the Mexican energy system?
-   What are the consequences of changing the dispatch system from merit to physical order dispatch?
-   What are the distributional consequences of high-electrification scenarios in North America?

Besides techno-economic models of the energy system, I am currently developing an Agent-Based Model of technology adoption with my colleagues at the European Institute on Economics and the Environment. The ABM-REN model aims to understand households' decisions to adopt green technologies.

I also contribute to the [37th Energy Modelling Forum](https://emf.stanford.edu/emf-37-deep-decarbonization-high-electrificatio-scenarios-north-america) on high electrification scenarios in North America.
